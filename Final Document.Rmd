```
For a one-unit increase in the predictor x1, the estimated log
odds changes by Î²1, while holding other predictors constant

price - For a one dollar increase in home price, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 decrease by 0.000000350 while holding other predictors constant.
bathrooms - For the house's inclusion of one additional bathroom, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 decrease by 0.676 while holding other predictors constant.
sqft_lot - For a 1 square foot increase in the size of the house's lot, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 increase by 0.0000448.
floors - For the house's inclusion of one additional floor, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 decrease by 1.258.
view - For a 1 unit increase in the view rating of the house, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 increase by 0.279.
condition - For a 1 unit increase in the condition rating of the house, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 increase by 1.798.
grade - For a 1 unit increase in the grade rating of the house, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 decrease by 0.281.
lat - For a 1 degree increase in latitude, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 will increase by 1.764.
long - For a 1 degree increase in longitude, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 will decrease by 0.893.
sqft_living15 - For a 1 square foot increase of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors, the estimated log odds of the house being built before or during 2007 increase by 0.000657.
